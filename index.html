    <h1> CLOUDS, SERVERS, SERVICES </h1>
    <h2> What is it? </h2>
    <br> 

    <p> Cloud computing and servers provide an over-the-internet service in which users can use for applications, storage and processing power. Most cloud computing services are over the internet, and allow for access on all devices as long as there is a connection to the internet. They are made with the intention that they can provide the same functions, support the same operating systems and applications, and offer similar performance characteristics as traditional physical servers. They work by virtualising physical servers in order to make them accessible to users from all locations. </p>
    <br>
    <p> The cloud itself is commonly used to refer to multiple servers that are connected to the internet and can be leased as a part of a software or application service. Cloud computing and servers are extremely beneficial as they are stable, fast and secure. Using them helps avoid hardware issues which can be seen with physical servers - and are most likely to be the most stable option for businesses that want to keep their budget low. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Cloud computing is mainly categorised into three different types being: PaaS: Platform as a service, SaaS: Software as a service and IaaS: Infrastructure as a service. </p>
    <br>
    <p> SaaS (Software as a service) represents the most commonly utilised option for business - it takes use of the internet in order to deliver applications which are managed by a third party vendor. A majority of SaaS applications run directly through your web browser, which means there isn’t any need for downloads or installations on the user’s side. It eliminates the need to have IT staff download and install applications on each individual device, with the use of SaaS, owners can manage all potential technical issues. It reduces time and money that would usually have been spent on tedious tasks such as installing, managing and upgrading software. </p> 
    <br>
    <p> Some examples of SaaS are:
    <ul>
    <li>Google Apps</li>
    <li>Drop Box</li>
    <li>Docusign</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <p> PaaS (Platform as a service) delivers a framework for developers that they can build upon and use to create customised applications. This allows all servers, storage and networking to be managed by a third-party. It’s similar to SaaS in terms of delivery - as they both deliver software over the net. PaaS provides a platform for software creation and allows businesses to design and create applications. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Some examples of PaaS are: </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Windows Azure</li>
    <li>Google app engine</li>
    <li>Openshift</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <p> IaaS (Infrastructure as a service) is a fully self-service for accessing and monitoring computers. IaaS allows businesses to purchase resources on-demand and as needed, saving time. IaaS gives clients complete control over the infrastructure and delivers cloud computing infrastructure, operating systems, storage, and servers over the internet virtually. It differs to PaaS and SaaS as clients are responsible for managing their applications. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Some examples of IaaS are: </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Linode</li>
    <li>Amazing Web Services</li>
    <li>DigitalOcean</li>
    </ul>


    
    <p> Currently cloud computing reinforces numerous services - including consumer services such as gmail or backing up of your phone. Large enterprises such as Netflix and Google also rely on cloud computing to function. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Cloud computing has been on the rise in the last few years, in fact 18% of companies with 1,000 employees or more have a multi-platform strategy. This number is said to rise by 90% by 2024. Considering the scale of cloud computing currently it’s only going to expand from here on, most, if not all, businesses will operate primarily from the cloud due to its flexible and efficient benefits. Making the use of hardware decrease. However the Cloud does introduce security concerns as it creates a situation where data privacy will become increasingly vulnerable. Companies and vendors will need to find a balance between hardware and software or improve the security issues faced by the use of Cloud computing. </p>
    <br>
    

    <h2> What is the likely impact? </h2>
    <br>
    <p> The increase and continuous development of Cloud computing, servers and services will allow for a beneficial impact on our society. The use of cloud allows businesses to reduce their costs and time spent. As well as the flexibility, mobility and reliability that it offers - currently and in the future it is making businesses more efficient and creating a more pleasant and easier experience for their clients and users. However there are challenges that will be faced, some being the vulnerable security system - the use of the cloud means less control over the data that is placed in it and as the cloud is accessed through the internet there is a risk of attack from hackers which can gain access to users’ data. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Businesses as well as everyday people who use technology will be the most affected as the implementation of cloud affects the way businesses and vendors manage their applications - whilst everyday people, users, will use these services and apply them to their everyday lives. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Jobs within the field of I.T will be forced to change - as the cloud grows bigger some jobs are no longer necessary. There will no longer be a need for administrators focused solely on storage needs, neither specifically on managing certain applications or hardware. Companies will need employees and workers to learn new skills and adjust to the larger use of cloud, servers and services. </p>

    

    <h2> What is the likely affect? </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
    Students will be affected positively as cloud makes itself a bigger use in the I.T world. With the ability to save work online and not have to worry about progress being lost due to technical issues  makes it easier for students to productively work without having to worry. And this can apply to anyone who uses the internet and its services.

    <h1> CYBER SECURITY </h1>
    <br>
    <h2> What is it? </h2>
    <br>

    <p>
    Cybersecurity is a broad department of I.T. focused on the protection and security of data. It can also be the other aspects, such as attacks to test the integrity of certain security setups. Cyber security helps businesses keep their valuable data intact and helps every day users stay safe. Firewalls, VPNS, proxies, antiviruses, all of these help keep data safe and are an aspect of Cybersecurity. You use different things depending on what you want to protect. Such as a network, or an application. Cybersecurity is used to protect from malware, adware, spyware, trojans, ransomware and botnets. The technology that is being used for cybersecurity now has remained the same for a while, such as firewalls, antivirus software, malware protection. However, these are being updated to keep up with the threats, and most companies with sensitive data have their own private version of these. These companies might sometimes pay people to try to break into their private firewalls or private networks, to test the integrity of their systems and see how an intrusion would happen. Cybersecurity has evolved rapidly through the years, due to massive cyber attacks such as WannaCry, which infected millions of computers, or the possible threat of a cyberwar with a rival country. As cybersecurity evolves, so does cybercrime. The practise of keeping secure while browsing the internet can be a hard challenge as everything nowadays is out to collect your data. Every website you click on, every app you download, every text message you send, everything you do on the internet uses some form of cyber security to make sure you stay safe while surfing. Websites use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to provide a secure connection to the website, where data from both ends are protected. Text messages that use Wi-Fi such as iMessage use end-to-end encryption to make sure no one snooping around the packets can see what was sent. All apps downloaded from the apple app store must go through apples rigours terms and services to make sure security is in check, while google play lets whatever on. Apple is a forefront for mobile security. They provide a secure experience when using their phone, notify the user when an application is doing anything out of the ordinary, and not allow the user to do anything stupid, such as download a virus or something along those lines. The problem with Apple’s security is that it does not provide the freedom that other phones using android have. This can be a plus for people, as they would not do anything out of the ordinary with their phones anyways. But Apple’s security method is to not give freedom to the user, making sure that nothing stupid can happen. And as more time passes, Apple’s security has toughened up, such as removing Fortnite from their app store due to breaking of terms and service. Antiviruses such as Windows Defender connect to the Microsoft server to keep up to date with major malware. But if you are not connected to the internet, and are only using Windows Defender, then your security levels drop. Security is starting to be taken more seriously as time goes on because everyday people are starting to notice how valuable their data is. It’s hard to protect yourself from something that rarely happens. People with little knowledge about the internet will fall victim to countless attacks such as adware or ransomware. We always think to ourselves, “That will never happen to me, I’m smarter than that.” But if people do not take security seriously, they will fall for the same attacks. Just because people do not see it, does not mean that it’s not there.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2> What is the likely impact? </h2>
    <br>
    <p> The impact of these developments in cybersecurity allows us users to browse the internet without the worry of any cyber-attacks. As time goes on, cyber security will continue to evolve and provide a level of safety for all users. But as cybersecurity evolves, so does cybercrime. The evolution of cybersecurity will change how we use our everyday products, such as using password programs to help keep our accounts secure or using VPNs to keep our internet browsing data a secret and staying anonymous. As these products become more available, more and more people will be using them and staying secure. The most likely group of people to be affected by the evolution in cybersecurity are people who do not know how to use computers safe and securely, such as elderly people. Souly because cyber-attacks are evolving with cybersecurity, and if they do not keep up to date with cybersecurity and update all their security programs, then they will fall victim to attacks. Most of the attacks pray on people like these because they fall for it the most. But hopefully one day cybersecurity will evolve to a level where even the technologically illiterate people will stay protected, and they can have a safer experience while surfing the world wide web. The evolution of security will provide new job possibilities for people, as security is being taken more seriously and will require a larger work force. The Australian government has spent a large sum of money to increase the security capabilities of the government facilities, and many other businesses are doing the same. The world needs more people working in security more than ever right now, as everything is being kept on servers and networks. If one thing were to go wrong, valuable data could be leaked to the wrong people, and who knows what could happen after that.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2> What is the likely affect? </h2>
    
    <p> Cybersecurity affects us all in our everyday life, including me. As I use a computer every day and am exposed to the elements of the internet, I need to make sure I stay safe and keep my cybersecurity up to date. The evolution of cybersecurity allows me to stay safe to new and upcoming threats, as well as keep my friends and family safe. My parents and grandparents will require teachings on how to be safe while traveling the internet if anything new comes up. The use of cybersecurity in everyday life can seem a bit tedious for someone who is fairly new to keeping their security safe, but as I’ve done for years, I will continue to keep safe using various tools that are being kept updated and try to use new tools also. My security will never get to the point of having a private network and private firewall, as I am still an everyday user, and the things that relate to me are the updates on everyday things. Such as antiviruses, and new forms of attacks that can happen. I’ve always taken security seriously, as I knew how valuable information stored on my computer could be, therefore I’ve practised keeping safe and so on for years now. Making the ever changing levels of cybersecurity not really affect my everyday life. </p>
